# Definitions of cracking patterns start here.

# H-containing molecules are defined with:
# molecule name, mass of the non-H atom(s)
# intensities of the peaks
# and relative intensity, compared to N2
# i.e. the intensity of the main peak relative to 
# intensity of N2 at the same pressure, at 28 AMU

# H-molecule definitions can be cloned
# in which case the source molecule must be specified
# and the mass of the non-H part.
# Peak definitions will be used as in the source molecule.
